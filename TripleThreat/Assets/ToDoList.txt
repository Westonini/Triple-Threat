If I ever decide to continue this project, these are some things to implement. - 8/24/19

Triple Threat ToDoList:

Mechanics/Etc:
- Add elements that spice up the game and make it more interesting.
- Add a script that adds coins after you finish a game depending on how many rounds you completed and save them to a static int.
- Hitting destructables like barrels, crates, and bushes have a chance to instantiate a heart which regains your health, power-ups, or a coin. 
- Make a main menu which leads to character selection. Show character info within character selection
- Add shop with 1 unlockable character


Enemy Ideas:
- Enemy that circles the player and throws ranged projectiles at them
- Enemy who throw up a ball which explodes into small spiky balls
- Enemy with sword and shield
- Ranged enemy who teleports or backs up if you're too close to them
